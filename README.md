# Spectre-Aegis — AO-7 Core Repo

This repo is the central playground for AO-7 and Echo.

- `dashboards/hydra/` — Hydra sports HUD & related assets
- Future dirs: `agents/`, `scripts/`, `pipelines/`, `docs/`

Goal: one place where Termux, AO-7 automations, and GitHub Actions all meet.

Developer tools
---------------
- We recommend installing the BLACKBOXAI VS Code extensions for faster iteration: search for `BLACKBOXAI` in the Extensions view and sign in to your Blackbox account from the extension's sidebar. The extensions are optional but helpful for code completion, refactoring, and agent features.
- Note: workspace `.vscode` settings are intentionally not committed; add your local preferences and extension recommendations to your editor to enable them for your environment.
